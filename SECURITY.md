## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within Vocalinux, please follow these steps:

### Do NOT

- Open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before it's fixed

### Do

1. **Email the maintainer directly**: Send an email to jatinkrmalik@gmail.com with:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Any suggested fixes (optional)

2. **Use the subject line**: "Vocalinux Security Vulnerability Report"

3. **Wait for acknowledgment**: You should receive a response within 48 hours

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: We'll evaluate the severity and impact
3. **Timeline**: We'll provide an estimated fix timeline
4. **Fix**: We'll work on a fix and coordinate disclosure
5. **Credit**: If desired, we'll credit you in the release notes

## Security Considerations

### Privacy

Vocalinux is designed with privacy in mind:

- **Offline by default**: whisper.cpp (default), Whisper, and VOSK engines all work completely offline
- **Local processing**: All speech recognition happens on your device
- **No data collection**: We don't collect or transmit your voice data
- **No telemetry**: We don't track usage or behavior

### whisper.cpp (Default Engine)

whisper.cpp is the default speech recognition engine:
- High-performance C++ implementation
- Processes completely locally on your machine
- Models are downloaded once and cached locally
- No audio data is sent to external servers
- Supports Vulkan GPU acceleration for AMD, Intel, and NVIDIA GPUs

### Whisper AI (OpenAI)

OpenAI's Whisper is also available as an alternative:
- PyTorch-based implementation
- Processes locally on your machine
- Models are downloaded once and cached locally
- No audio data is sent to external servers

### Model Download Integrity

Speech recognition models are large binaries fetched from third parties — Hugging
Face (whisper.cpp), Alphacephei (VOSK) and OpenAI's CDN (Whisper) — and are then
loaded into the Vocalinux process. Every model the app can download is pinned in
`src/vocalinux/utils/model_hashes.json` with its SHA256 digest and byte size, and
both the runtime downloader and `install.sh` verify a download against that pin
before the file is installed or unpacked.

What the checks cover:

| Check | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Pinned SHA256 + size | A file whose bytes differ from the reviewed pin is deleted, not installed |
| HTTPS on a known host | Download URLs must be HTTPS on huggingface.co, alphacephei.com or openaipublic.azureedge.net |
| Redirect guard | A redirect that downgrades to plain HTTP aborts the download |
| Archive path validation | VOSK zips are rejected if any member is absolute, traverses out of the models directory, or is a symlink |
| Expansion cap | An archive that unpacks to more than 8 GiB is refused |

Pinning gives integrity, not authenticity. A digest recorded from a file that was
already malicious upstream would still match. What it does guarantee is that the
bytes were reviewed once, in a pull request, and cannot silently change
afterwards: a swapped or corrupted model, a tampering proxy, or a truncated
download all fail the check.

Digests are regenerated with `scripts/update_model_hashes.py`. whisper.cpp
digests come from Hugging Face's Git LFS metadata, Whisper digests come from the
SHA256 that OpenAI embeds in each download URL, and VOSK archives are streamed
and hashed locally with their published MD5 used as a cross-check.

Set `VOCALINUX_STRICT_MODEL_VERIFICATION=1` to refuse any model that has no
pinned digest instead of downloading it with a warning. Every model currently
reachable from the UI is pinned, so strict mode only matters if you add a new
model or edit the registry.

### File Permissions

The application stores data in:
- `~/.config/vocalinux/` - Configuration (mode 700)
- `~/.local/share/vocalinux/` - Data and models (mode 700)

### Known Limitations

1. **Text injection**: Uses xdotool/wtype which may have implications for input monitoring
2. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Global keyboard hooks require appropriate permissions
3. **Virtual environments**: Running in a venv provides some isolation

## Updates

Keep your installation updated to receive security fixes:

```bash
cd vocalinux
git pull origin main
pip install --upgrade -e .
```
