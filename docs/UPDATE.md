# Updating Vocalinux

This guide explains how to update Vocalinux to the latest version.

## What's New in v0.14.2

0.14.2 is a stability patch on the **0.14 series**. The feature set is the same as 0.14.x; this release only fixes IBus reliability.

### 0.14 series highlights

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Configurable Shortcuts** | Bind any modifier combination to a key — e.g. `Alt+R`, `Ctrl+Shift+V`, or `Super+F10` |
| **FunASR / SenseVoice Remote API** | Remote-API engine supports FunASR and SenseVoice via OpenAI-compatible endpoints |
| **Flatpak packaging** | Universal Flatpak (whisper.cpp) with sandbox-aware paths, global hotkeys, and Wayland paste injection |
| **AUR package** | Official Arch packaging and CI publish path |
| **Layout-aware hotkeys** | Combo keys respect non-US layouts |
| **Wayland / IBus reliability** | GNOME and KDE injection fixes, first-dictation FocusIn gate, engine process launch restored |
| **Audio / hybrid-CPU** | Recording device-index crash fixed; whisper.cpp no longer defaults to all cores on hybrid CPUs |

### Bug fixes in v0.14.2

- **IBus**: Restore engine process launch after the Flatpak XDG path import change. `start_engine_process` and the IBus component exec run `ibus_engine.py` by path, so the relative import failed with `ImportError` and Vocalinux fell back to ydotool/clipboard paste (#534)
- **IBus**: Wait for FocusIn before commit on scoped injection. Cold first activation on GNOME Wayland could commit before mutter bound a client context, so the first dictation of a session was dropped while logs still reported success (#533, fixes #523)

See the [full changelog](https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocalinux/releases/tag/v0.14.2).

## What's New in v0.14.1

### Highlights

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Flatpak packaging** | Universal Flatpak (whisper.cpp) with sandbox-aware paths, global hotkeys, and Wayland paste injection |
| **AUR package** | Official Arch packaging and CI publish path |
| **Layout-aware hotkeys** | Combo keys respect non-US layouts |
| **Installer / injection fixes** | `sg` on Ubuntu 26.04/Debian 13; XIM `none` treated as unset |

- **AUR release package** — PKGBUILD and CI publish for Arch Linux (#518)

### Bug Fixes

## What's New in v0.14.0-beta

### Highlights

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Configurable Shortcuts** | Bind any modifier combination to a key — e.g. `Alt+R`, `Ctrl+Shift+V`, or `Super+F10` |
| **FunASR / SenseVoice Remote API** | Remote-API engine now supports FunASR and SenseVoice models via OpenAI-compatible endpoints |
| **GNOME Wayland IBus Reliability** | Text injection works again on GNOME Wayland with bare `xkb` layouts and engine restore fallbacks are fixed |
| **Audio Crash Fix** | Recording no longer crashes when the system audio device index changes between sessions |
| **Hybrid-CPU Efficiency** | whisper.cpp no longer defaults to all cores on hybrid Intel/AMD processors |

### ✨ New Features

- **Configurable modifier+key hotkeys** — The Settings dialog now lets you set custom shortcuts using any combination of Ctrl, Alt, Shift, and Super plus a letter/number key. The legacy defaults still work, and you can now bind combinations like `Alt+R` or `Ctrl+Shift+V` (#493)
- **Remote API FunASR/SenseVoice support** — OpenAI-compatible remote endpoints can specify FunASR/SenseVoice model names (e.g. `sensevoice`) and return richer response shapes; SenseVoice metadata labels are stripped before text injection (#468)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **GNOME Wayland/IBus**: Restore text injection when only a bare `xkb` engine is configured; the engine restore fallback now picks the correct IM engine instead of silently dropping text (#506, #500)
- **KDE Wayland/IBus**: Restore the KDE Plasma Wayland IBus text-injection path that was regressed in recent compositor-detection changes (#502)
- **Wayland injection**: Wait for held modifiers (Ctrl/Alt/Shift/Super) to release before injecting text, preventing accidental shortcut triggers and garbled output on modifier-heavy workflows (#494)
- **Shortcuts UI**: Keep preset and custom shortcut selection exclusive — selecting a preset now clears the custom field, and setting a custom combo selects the "Custom Shortcut" preset (#509)
- **whisper.cpp**: Stop defaulting to all CPU cores on hybrid processors (Intel Performance + Efficient cores), which caused UI lag and excess battery drain (#492)
- **Audio**: Fix a crash on recording start when the selected audio device index no longer matches the current system enumeration (#499)
- **Installer**: Include `xsel` as a fallback for the Wayland clipboard path when `xclip` is unavailable (#496)

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Code style** — Removed an outdated long comment about whisper.cpp default thread counts (#505)

See the [full changelog](https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocalinux/releases/tag/v0.14.0-beta).

## What's New in v0.13.0-beta

### 🚀 Highlights

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **🎙️ Guided Whisper Models** | Pick a whisper.cpp size and specialization (English-only, quantized, Turbo) with in-app guidance |
| **🔌 Hotplug Keyboard Support** | Shortcuts keep working on keyboards connected after startup |
| **✍️ Dictation Spacing** | Spacing preserved between speech segments separated by a pause in the same session |
| **🖥️ Wayland Reliability** | Fixes silent text drops on wlroots/COSMIC compositors and garbled non-US-layout output |

### ✨ New Features

- **Guided whisper.cpp model variants** — The Settings dialog now splits whisper.cpp selection into **Model Size** and **Specialization**, exposing English-only, quantized (Q5/Q8), Large v3 Turbo, and legacy large models with language-aware recommendations and hover guidance. Exact model IDs (e.g. `medium.en-q5_0`, `large-v3-turbo`) can also be passed to `--model` (#465)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Dictation**: Preserve spacing between speech segments separated by a pause (#464)
- **Shortcuts**: Rescan for hotplugged keyboards so shortcuts work on devices connected after startup (#467)
- **KDE Plasma Wayland**: Detect KDE Plasma Wayland sessions and guide you to enable IBus Wayland when `wtype` injection fails (#466)
- **Wayland**: Fix garbled output on non-US keyboard layouts and a clipboard-copy hang; ydotool now pastes through the clipboard (#480)
- **Wayland/IBus**: Use wtype/ydotool instead of IBus on compositors that don't bridge IBus to native apps like COSMIC, Sway, and Hyprland (#486)
- **Wayland/IBus**: Require a real IM engine on Wayland so a bare `xkb` layout no longer causes silent text drops on GNOME/Mutter and similar (#478)
- **Wayland**: Preserve the keyboard layout on Wayland by not running `setxkbmap` (was flipping XWayland apps to `us`) (#474)
- **UI**: Cap the settings dialog height on high-resolution displays (#465)

### 🔧 Improvements

- **Performance**: Faster ydotool text injection via an explicit `--key-delay` (#488)
- **Website**: New documentation pages for Remote API, Silero VAD, advanced whisper.cpp settings, and desktop reliability (#470)
- **CI**: Automatic pull-request labeling by changed files (#473)

See the [full changelog](https://github.com/jatinkrmalik/vocalinux/releases/tag/v0.13.0-beta).

```

The installer will:
- ✅ Detect and stop any running Vocalinux processes
- ✅ Update your existing installation
- ✅ Preserve your configuration and models
- ✅ Install any new dependencies
- ✅ Attempt to install neural VAD support, falling back safely if ONNX Runtime is unavailable

### If You Installed from Source

```bash
cd vocalinux
git fetch origin
git checkout v0.14.2
./install.sh
```

Or to get the latest development version:

```bash
cd vocalinux
git pull origin main
./install.sh
```

---

## Checking Your Current Version

```bash
python3 -c "import vocalinux; print(vocalinux.version.__version__)"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Update Issues?

If your update doesn't go smoothly, try a clean reinstall:

```bash
# Uninstall (keeps your config and models by default)
./uninstall.sh --keep-config --keep-data

# Or uninstall completely
./uninstall.sh

# Reinstall fresh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jatinkrmalik/vocalinux/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Old Version Still Running

```bash
# Kill any running instances
pkill -f vocalinux

# Start fresh
vocalinux
```
